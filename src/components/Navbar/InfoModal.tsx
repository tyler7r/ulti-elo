                        <em>sigma</em> (uncertainty). After every game, your{" "}
                        <em>mu</em> goes up or down depending on your

                          games, you will likely see large ELO jumps with each
                          game but as you play more this measure will start to
                          stabilize.

                        difference, the more your rating changes. If you barely
                        win, your ELO will not increase much, but if you
                        dominate, you gain more.
