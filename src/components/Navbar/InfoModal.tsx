                      Your **ELO rating** is a number that represents your skill

                      whether you win or lose, who you played against, and the
                      score difference.

                        hidden values: <em>mu</em> (your skill) and{" "}
                        <em>sigma</em> (uncertainty). After every game, your{" "}
                        <em>mu</em> goes up or down depending on your
                        performance. Your ELO is simply: <em>mu</em> * 100.

                        decrease your <em>sigma</em> (uncertainty). A high{" "}
                        <em>sigma</em> means a higher shift in ELO associated
                        with that game.

                          games, you will likely see large ELO jumps with each
                          game but as you play more this measure will start to
                          stabilize.

                        difference, the more your rating changes. If you barely
                        win, your ELO will not increase much, but if you
                        dominate, you gain more.

                        average ELO of each squad is taken to determine their
                        respective strength score. If your squad beats a
                        stronger opponent, you gain extra ELO points and in turn
                        they lose extra ELO points. This makes it rewarding to
